#  Deep Learning Based Approach for Image Captioning by Exploiting Priority Factor
In this repository, we share the dataset used to evaluate different variations of a new automatic image captioning system that we introduced in a research paper with the name as the title above. The dataset is part of MS-COCO, a widely used dataset in computer vision literature. The zipped file “train2014” contains a collection of 82793 copyright-free images in jpg format that can be used for deep learning training tasks with minimal preprocessing workload. Similarly, the zipped file “val2014” contains a collection of 40504 copyright-free images in jpg format for model validation purpose. The repository also offers annotations in json format that can be used to compare captions generated from a captioning system of one’s choice.
